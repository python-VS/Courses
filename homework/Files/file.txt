The spice tastes very good to me.
I love it.
But the built of the bottles lid is very poor.
The lid won't close at all(the flaps), you close it and it opens back up due to which the spice inside the box was exposed to air and it all sticked together (formed a clump).
Which was very disappointing.
Such a good tasting spice and half the bottle gone to waste.
